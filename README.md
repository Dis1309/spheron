<h2 id="about-the-project">About The Project</h2>

Our decentralized bug bounty platform is reshaping how security vulnerabilities are reported, managed, and rewarded. Using blockchain technology, each project is listed as an NFT, giving contributors a verifiable source of truth. Built on the Sphereon blockchain using the Move language, we offer secure, transparent, and efficient payments through smart contracts—ensuring that contributors are fairly compensated based on the issues they resolve.

<h3 id="mission">Mission:</h3>

We aim to provide a seamless, secure, and transparent bug bounty experience for both project owners and contributors. By decentralizing the process, our platform removes intermediaries, reduces delays, and ensures real-time payments for contributors who resolve issues.

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition:</h3>

1. **Decentralized Security**: Our projects are stored as NFTs, providing decentralized protection and eliminating the reliance on centralized systems prone to vulnerabilities.
2. **Transparent Bounty Distribution**: Through blockchain-backed smart contracts, we ensure that each contributor is paid fairly and promptly for their work.
3. **AI-Assisted Categorization**: Our AI-driven system streamlines the process of evaluating issues by automatically categorizing them into Critical, High, or Low tiers.
4. **Blockchain-Powered Payments**: Contributors are paid securely in cryptocurrency upon completion of the project timeline, with funds distributed transparently based on the severity of the issue resolved.

<h2 id="key-features">Key Features</h2>

1. **Project Listing as NFTs**: Each project is represented as a unique NFT, ensuring the immutability and transparency of the project’s data, giving contributors verifiable proof of the project’s existence and legitimacy.
  
2. **Dynamic Bounty Distribution**: Project owners can allocate bounties across three tiers—Critical, High, and Low—allowing for flexible and fair reward distribution based on the severity of issues resolved.
  
3. **AI-Assisted Issue Categorization**: Our advanced AI models analyze and categorize reported issues into appropriate tiers, significantly reducing the time and effort spent on manual evaluation.
  
4. **Blockchain-Backed Payments**: All transactions and bounty payments are handled via smart contracts on the Sphereon blockchain, ensuring fast, secure, and transparent payouts directly to contributors' wallets.
  
5. **Decentralized Data Storage**: Project and issue-related data are securely stored on the blockchain using NFTs, providing a tamper-proof and immutable record, reducing the risk of centralized server failures or attacks.
  
6. **Secure and Transparent Transactions**: Every transaction is verified and executed through smart contracts, removing the need for intermediaries and ensuring trustless, secure payments.
