<h2 id="about-the-project">About The Project</h2>

Our decentralized bug bounty platform is reshaping the future of project development by bridging the gap between ideas and technical knowledge. Using blockchain technology, each project is listed as an NFT, giving contributors a verifiable source of truth. Built on the Aptos blockchain using the Move language, we offer secure, transparent, and efficient payments through smart contracts—ensuring that contributors are fairly compensated based on the issues they resolve.

<h2 id="mission">Mission:</h2>

We aim to provide a **seamless, secure, and transparent bug bounty experience** for both project owners and contributors. By decentralizing the process, our platform **removes intermediaries, reduces delays**, and ensures **real-time payments** for contributors who resolve issues.

Additionally, we focus on **bridging the gap between creativity and technical knowledge deficiency**. Anyone with an innovative idea but lacking the technical resources can come to our platform, describe their vision, and **connect with technically knowledgeable contributors** who can bring their ideas to life.

With our platform, project owners can transform their concepts into reality, while contributors gain the opportunity to apply their skills in impactful ways and earn money.

<h2 id="visuals">Visual Representation</h2>

Here’s the revised section that introduces the code snippet, focusing on the **Dynamic Bounty Distribution** feature implemented in Move language:

### Code Snippets to Highlight Features:

For the **Dynamic Bounty Prize Distribution** feature, here’s how smart contracts can dynamically allocate bounties based on issue severity using Move:

```move
public entry fun transaction_winners(
        deployer: &signer,
        project_id: u64,
        high: u64,
        critical: u64,
        low: u64
    ) acquires ProjectMapping, {
       let project_mapping = borrow_global<ProjectMapping>(@account_address);
       let all_projects = project_mapping.projects;
       let projectMain =simple_map::borrow(&mut all_projects,&project_id);
       let project = projectMain.contributors;
       let len = vector::length(&project);
        let mp:SimpleMap<address,u64> = simple_map::create(); 
       for (i in 0..len) {
         let contributor = vector::borrow(&project,i);
         let amount:u64 = 0;
         
         if(contributor.level ==  string::utf8(b"High")) {
           amount = projectMain.high_bounty/high;
         } else if(contributor.level ==  string::utf8(b"Critical")) {
           amount = projectMain.critical_bounty/critical;
         } else amount = projectMain.low_bounty/low;

         if(simple_map::contains_key(&mut mp,&contributor.issuer)==false) {
             simple_map::add(&mut mp, contributor.issuer,amount); 
         } else {
            let tmp:u64 = *simple_map::borrow(&mut mp,&contributor.issuer);
            amount = amount + tmp;
            simple_map::upsert(&mut mp,contributor.issuer,amount );
         };
       };
       for (i in 0..len) {
         let contributor = vector::borrow(&project,i);
         if(simple_map::contains_key(&mut mp,&contributor.issuer)==true) {
            let value = *simple_map::borrow(&mut mp,&contributor.issuer);
            let add:address = @account_address;
            transfer(deployer, contributor.issuer, value);
         };
       };
    }
```

### Key Functions:

1. **`initialize`**: reads the required contributors of the project
2. **`allocates bounty`**: Allows the owner to allocate rewards based on the severity of reported issues (Critical, High, Low).
3. **`send bounties`**: Enables contributors to get the allocated bounties.
---

To showcase the **AI-Assisted Issue Categorization**, we developed a chatbot using **RASA** that helps users find relevant projects based on their prompts and can provide detailed information about specific projects.

### RASA Chatbot Implementation

The RASA chatbot utilizes natural language processing to understand user queries and suggest projects that align with their interests. Below is a simplified implementation highlighting key components of the RASA framework:

```yaml
# config.yml - RASA configuration file

language: en
pipeline:
  - name: WhitespaceTokenizer
  - name: CountVectorsFeaturizer
  - name: DIETClassifier
  - name: EntitySynonymMapper
  - name: ResponseSelector
  - name: DialoguePolicy

# domain.yml - RASA domain file
intents:
  - greet
  - ask_projects
  - request_details

responses:
  utter_greet:
    - text: "Hello! How can I assist you today?"
  utter_ask_projects:
    - text: "I can help you find projects based on your interests. What are you looking for?"
  utter_project_details:
    - text: "Here are the details of the project you're interested in: {project_name}"

# stories.yml - Example user stories
stories:
  - story: greet and ask for projects
    steps:
      - intent: greet
      - action: utter_greet
      - intent: ask_projects
      - action: utter_ask_projects
```

### Key Features:

1. **Project Recommendations**: The chatbot understands user prompts to suggest relevant projects based on their interests and requirements.
2. **Detailed Information**: Users can request more information about specific projects, and the chatbot provides insights on features, technology stacks, and more.
3. **Interactive Experience**: Users can engage in a conversation with the chatbot, making it easier to find projects that suit their needs.

This RASA-powered chatbot enhances user experience by leveraging AI to provide tailored project recommendations and information, streamlining the process of finding suitable projects within our platform.
