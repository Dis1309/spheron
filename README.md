<h2 id="about-the-project">About The Project</h2>

Our decentralized bug bounty platform is reshaping how security vulnerabilities are reported, managed, and rewarded. Using blockchain technology, each project is listed as an NFT, giving contributors a verifiable source of truth. Built on the Sphereon blockchain using the Move language, we offer secure, transparent, and efficient payments through smart contracts—ensuring that contributors are fairly compensated based on the issues they resolve.

<h3 id="mission">Mission:</h3>

We aim to provide a seamless, secure, and transparent bug bounty experience for both project owners and contributors. By decentralizing the process, our platform removes intermediaries, reduces delays, and ensures real-time payments for contributors who resolve issues.

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition:</h3>

1. **Decentralized Security**: Our projects are stored as NFTs, providing decentralized protection and eliminating the reliance on centralized systems prone to vulnerabilities.
2. **Transparent Bounty Distribution**: Through blockchain-backed smart contracts, we ensure that each contributor is paid fairly and promptly for their work.

*The above diagram illustrates the process flow from project listing to vulnerability reporting and payment distribution.*

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<h2 id="key-features">Key Features</h2>

1. **Project Listing as NFTs**:  
   Every project on our platform is tokenized as a unique NFT. This ensures **transparency**, **immutability**, and a **trustless** environment. Contributors can verify the project’s authenticity and ownership directly on the blockchain, eliminating potential fraud and manipulation. By leveraging the decentralized nature of NFTs, project owners can prove that the project details are securely stored and immutable.

   <img src="images/nft-project-listing.gif" alt="NFT Project Listing" width="600"/>

2. **Dynamic Bounty Distribution**:  
   Our platform provides a flexible, tier-based bounty distribution system, enabling project owners to allocate rewards dynamically. Based on the severity of identified vulnerabilities, contributors are compensated under **Critical**, **High**, and **Low** tiers. This ensures fair and **meritocratic distribution** of rewards, motivating bug hunters to resolve more significant security issues for higher incentives.

   <img src="images/dynamic-bounty.gif" alt="Dynamic Bounty Distribution" width="600"/>

3. **AI-Assisted Issue Categorization**:  
   **AI integration** allows our platform to categorize issues based on their severity efficiently. By using cutting-edge machine learning models trained on vast security data, our AI system automatically assigns issues into the appropriate tiers: **Critical**, **High**, or **Low**. This saves project owners time and reduces manual evaluation efforts while improving accuracy in identifying priority vulnerabilities.

   <img src="images/ai-assisted-categorization.gif" alt="AI-Assisted Categorization" width="600"/>

4. **Blockchain-Backed Payments**:  
   Payments on our platform are facilitated through blockchain-backed smart contracts. Contributors are paid directly and securely in cryptocurrency after completing their tasks. Our smart contracts ensure **instant**, **transparent**, and **trustless** transactions without intermediaries, giving contributors peace of mind and a secure payment gateway.

   <img src="images/blockchain-payments.gif" alt="Blockchain Payments" width="600"/>

5. **Decentralized Data Storage**:  
   All project-related data, including reported issues and their corresponding bounties, are securely stored using **NFTs on the blockchain**. This decentralized storage model ensures a **tamper-proof**, **secure**, and **immutable** record of the entire bug-bounty process, reducing reliance on centralized servers and increasing data reliability.

   <img src="images/decentralized-storage.gif" alt="Decentralized Data Storage" width="600"/>

6. **Secure and Transparent Transactions**:  
   Every financial transaction made on the platform is executed through **smart contracts**, removing the need for third-party intermediaries. By using blockchain technology, we guarantee the security and transparency of transactions, making it impossible for malicious actors to tamper with the payment processes. Additionally, both contributors and project owners can verify the integrity of all payments on the public ledger.

   <img src="images/secure-transactions.gif" alt="Secure Transactions" width="600"/>

7. **Real-Time Bounty Updates**:  
   Contributors and project owners can track bounty progress in real-time. As issues are resolved and confirmed, bounties are automatically adjusted and reflected on the platform, providing full transparency and allowing for instant feedback loops between the two parties.

### Code Snippets to Highlight Features:

For the **Dynamic Bounty Distribution** feature, here's an example of how smart contracts can dynamically allocate bounties based on issue severity using Solidity:

```solidity
// Example Solidity contract for dynamic bounty allocation

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract BountyDistribution {
    address owner;
    uint public criticalReward = 10 ether;
    uint public highReward = 5 ether;
    uint public lowReward = 2 ether;
    
    mapping(address => uint) public rewards;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    // Function to allocate rewards based on severity
    function allocateBounty(address contributor, uint severity) external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can allocate bounties");

        if (severity == 1) {
            rewards[contributor] += criticalReward;
        } else if (severity == 2) {
            rewards[contributor] += highReward;
        } else if (severity == 3) {
            rewards[contributor] += lowReward;
        }
    }

    // Function for contributors to claim rewards
    function claimReward() external {
        uint reward = rewards[msg.sender];
        require(reward > 0, "No rewards to claim");
        rewards[msg.sender] = 0;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(reward);
    }
    
    // Function to fund the contract
    function deposit() external payable {}
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Severity-Based Bounty Allocation**: The contract allows for dynamic allocation of bounties to contributors based on the severity of the issue (Critical, High, Low).
- **Claim Functionality**: Contributors can claim their rewards, which are automatically transferred via blockchain-backed payments.
- **Security**: Only the owner of the contract (project owner) can allocate bounties.

---

To showcase the **AI-Assisted Issue Categorization**, we can use TensorFlow models to predict issue severity based on input data:

```python
# Example Python code using TensorFlow for AI-Assisted Categorization

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Sample neural network for issue severity prediction
def create_model():
    model = models.Sequential()
    model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_shape,)))
    model.add(layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'))
    model.add(layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax'))  # Output: Critical, High, Low
    return model

# Compile the model
model = create_model()
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Example issue data for training the AI model
train_data = ...
train_labels = ...

# Train the model to predict issue severity
model.fit(train_data, train_labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Predict the category of a new issue
new_issue_data = ...
predicted_severity = model.predict(new_issue_data)

# Output: Predicted severity category (Critical, High, Low)
```

### Explanation:
- **AI Model**: A simple neural network is used to categorize issues based on the input data (issue reports).
- **Prediction**: The model can predict whether an issue falls into **Critical**, **High**, or **Low** severity categories.
