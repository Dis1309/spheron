Here’s the revised section that introduces the code snippet, focusing on the **Dynamic Bounty Distribution** feature implemented in Move language:

### Code Snippets to Highlight Features:

For the **Dynamic Bounty Distribution** feature, here’s how smart contracts can dynamically allocate bounties based on issue severity using Move:

```move
// BountyDistribution.move

module BountyDistribution {
    use aptos_framework::coin;
    use aptos_framework::account;

    struct BountyDistribution {
        owner: address,
        rewards: map<address, u64>,
    }

    // Initialize the Bounty Distribution contract
    public fun initialize(owner: address) {
        let distribution = BountyDistribution {
            owner,
            rewards: map::empty<address, u64>(),
        };
        account::save_owner(owner, distribution);
    }

    // Allocate rewards based on severity
    public fun allocate_bounty(distribution: &mut BountyDistribution, contributor: address, severity: u8) {
        assert!(msg::sender() == distribution.owner, "Only owner can allocate bounties");
        
        let reward = match severity {
            1 => 10_000_000, // Critical
            2 => 5_000_000,  // High
            3 => 2_000_000,  // Low
            _ => 0,
        };

        if reward > 0 {
            let current_reward = map::get(&distribution.rewards, contributor).unwrap_or(0);
            map::insert(&mut distribution.rewards, contributor, current_reward + reward);
        }
    }

    // Claim rewards by the contributor
    public fun claim_reward(distribution: &mut BountyDistribution, contributor: address) {
        let reward = map::remove(&mut distribution.rewards, contributor).unwrap_or(0);
        assert!(reward > 0, "No rewards to claim");

        coin::transfer(&distribution.owner, contributor, reward);
    }
}
```

### Key Functions:

1. **`initialize`**: Sets up the contract with the owner's address and initializes the rewards mapping.
2. **`allocate_bounty`**: Allows the owner to allocate rewards based on the severity of reported issues (Critical, High, Low).
3. **`claim_reward`**: Enables contributors to claim their allocated rewards securely.

    - text: "Hello! How can I assist you today?"
  utter_ask_projects:
    - text: "I can help you find projects based on your interests. What are you looking for?"
  utter_project_details:
    - text: "Here are the details of the project you're interested in: {project_name}"

# stories.yml - Example user stories
stories:
  - story: greet and ask for projects
    steps:
      - intent: greet
      - action: utter_greet
      - intent: ask_projects
      - action: utter_ask_projects
```

### Key Features:

1. **Project Recommendations**: The chatbot understands user prompts to suggest relevant projects based on their interests and requirements.
2. **Detailed Information**: Users can request more information about specific projects, and the chatbot provides insights on features, technology stacks, and more.
